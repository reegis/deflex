Installation
============

If you have a working Python 3 environment, use pypi to install the latest reegis version:

::

    pip install reegis

The reegis library is designed for Python 3 and tested on Python >= 3.6. We highly recommend to use virtual environments.
Please see the `installation page <http://oemof.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation_and_setup.html>`_ of the oemof documentation for complete instructions on how to install python and a virtual environment on your operating system.


Basic usage
===========

Soon.


Contributing
==============

We are warmly welcoming all who want to contribute to the deflex library.


Citing reegis
========================

We soon will use the zenodo project to get a DOI for each version.
