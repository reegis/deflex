# Look in your folder above. You should see some scenario files. The csv and

# the computer but the xlsx-files are easier to read for humans because all
# sheets are in one file.

# NOTE: Large models will need up to 24 GB of RAM, so start with small models
# and increase the size step by step. You can also use large models with less
# time steps but you have to adapt the annual limits.

# Now choose one example. We will start with a small one:
